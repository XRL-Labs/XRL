# XRL / LootLARP
***A platform for collective worldmaking & gamified real world experiences***

Hi everyone! We are **XRL Labs** and we’re excited to share what we’ve been working on with you all.

Web3 has a growing problem: communities and protocols need non-financial markers of reputation to build effective incentives. Vitalik has [written](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) and [spoken](https://youtu.be/Geg2-ru5eik?t=3385) about this on numerous occasions, and we believe we have a solution to add to the Web3 toolbox.

Inspired by [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com), the CC0 NFT community, and broader industry conversations around Lore (as a community or DAO primitive), we are creating a critical new piece of Web3 infrastructure to enable collective worldmaking: a composable platform for community onboarding, governance, and gamification. In doing so, we aim to empower builders, artists and community organizers with new tools that take the superpowers of tokenomics, and infuse them into high fidelity “real world” physical experiences. 

We believe that shared histories (ie. Lore) are the basis for community solidarity. By increasing player agency and ownership over the creation of narrative canon, we’re creating more opportunities for players to emotionally invest in the worlds they’re making. The result is a feeling of belonging, where players can more readily find the communities and experiences they’re seeking.

We are building our platform **XRL** to bring attention to this emerging design space. Our aim is to contribute to expanded visions of what future “metaverses'' could be, enabling hybrid digital-physical experiences that are “body-centred”, activating all senses, as opposed to exclusively “screen-centred”.

LootLARP, our first offering & homage to the eternally magical Loot ecosystem, blends the joys of MMORPGs and real world Live Action Role Playing with physical hardware interfaces that allow players to explore & interact with an immersive world. 

The LootLARP experience is built on top of the **XRL** platform to demonstrate the potential for this foundational technology, empowering new types of play anchored in collective worldmaking. This experience will be debuting at NFT.NYC in June 2022.

### How?

The **XRL** platform is a suite of tools:

KONG HaLo-enabled items - these are hardware interfaces required to play the game, which enable the creation of "proofs of presence", or extra layer of spoof/sybil protection.
Client web app & associated smart contracts/protocol - this is the core infrastructure for playing the game and interacting with the world, as demoed below.
No/low-code Quest editor (future state) - this is a creator tool to enable prospective game & experience designers to create their own quests and mini-games to add to the world, even if they aren't developers or "technical". Having said that, there will also be an expert mode and developer documentation for creators fluent in smart contracts to build elaborate custom experiences into their quests.

The client app serves as an interface to surface a player's status in the world, essentially serving as a "quest journal" (keeping track of quests), and character profile (keeping track of progress). The app is also the main hub where players interact with other players and objects. It forms and sends the blockchain transactions that begin and advance quests, in conjunction with KONG HaLo-chip enabled physical items and props. Specifically, the KONG HaLo chip on the physical items will be signing & verifying transactions, whereas the client app will be forming & sending them - this way, the item is your "key" to the world.

Quest NFTs will help track a player's progress throughout the world, and the global game state on the blockchain will reflect the lore (ie. collective player reputation graphs) of the world, as created by player actions and achievements.

LootLARP will serve as a case study that inspires others to see the potential of the **XRL** platform and build on top of it, for whatever use cases their communities may require. We are proud KONG Land Citizens, and work alongside our fellow DAO members to manifest an equitable future using these tools - every KONG HaLo chip will eventually be a potential site of activation for use in our platform, either as a player interface or quest prop. 

**XRL** could become a powerful tool that enables new types of governance, better airdrops, complex token gating, and the creation of rare, life-changing, collective experiences. As crypto continues to eat the world, this tool can exponentiate the “spirit of play” already ubiquitous in Web3 - a truly revolutionary spark.

Ultimately, we believe Quest NFTs and the core **XRL** protocol need to become open standards & publicly available to every community seeking to use them. In the interim, we seek Gitcoin funding to continue building this technology suite and the infrastructure that can enable it. Our gitcoin grant is awaiting approval, and a link will be posted here once the grant is live.

Funds will be used to:

- Finish our MVP platform in advance of LootLARP (closed alpha)
- Begin specification development and build on our Quest Editor
- Explore and pursue privacy solutions and related protocol integrations
- Explore cross-chain infrastructure (we are currently targeting Mainnet and Polygon)
- Explore and outline process to safely open up access to the **XRL** platform for permissionless quest contributions
- Map out and pursue standardization processes around Quest NFTs & associated infrastructure
- Develop free op-sec & wallet management guide for privacy-conscious players
- Explore and partner with promising NPOs and/or Gitcoin grant recipients to develop a climate-focused initiative integrating the **XRL** platform

We deeply appreciate your support and welcome all comments, questions, suggestions and feedback about what we are building.
